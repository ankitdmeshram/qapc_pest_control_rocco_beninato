                    <h1>Rat Removal Services</h1>

                    <p>Our skilled team of rat exterminator technicians at Quality Affordable Pest Control provides fast and effective rat removal and rat control services. We will rid your home or business of rats using a variety of tactics. When it comes to rats, it's important to pay close attention because bad training or baiting can have unintended repercussions. To prevent domestic or wild animal poisoning, the legislation requires only the highest-quality equipment to be utilised.</p>

                    <p>You may be asking yourself, "Why do I have rats?" at this point. The short answer is that rat removal is becoming increasingly common. The native rodent habitat is continuously being disrupted as our region expands. As a result, these rats are compelled to seek food and shelter elsewhere. If you do have this difficulty, though, you are not alone. We'll take care of any rodent infestations you might have!</p>

                    <h4  class="pt-3">Facts About Rats in Your Home:</h4>

                    <p>This nocturnal creature wants to be alone at night. It eats mostly grass and scavenges near abandoned houses and structures. Rats in Canada typically have one litter per year (averaging 3-4 young).</p>
                    <p>Young rats reach maturity in ten weeks, and it takes ten weeks for them to reproduce, resulting in a much larger problem. If there is an excess of food available, such as pet food, a small population of rats can grow exponentially over the course of a year. Rats can be hazardous to one's health and potentially cause property damage. Dirtballs can carry diseases and contaminate food supplies. Rats can also carry diseases like rat-bite fever, leptospirosis, plague, and hemorrhagic fever, among others. They have a reputation for chewing on electrical cables, which could put the structure at jeopardy over time. Rats can compromise the structural integrity of a structure if left unchecked, whether you're a business owner or a homeowner. If you have a rat problem, QAPC can help you get rid of the pests using only high-quality, safe treatments.</p>

                    <h4>What Do Rats Look For When Nesting or Looking For Food?
                    </h4>

                    <p>The majority of rats begin infestations by seeking food and shelter. Termites will penetrate homes, businesses, warehouses, factories, granaries, and farms, to name a few. They can chew through wood and plastic with their teeth, making it easier for them to get into places.</p>
                    <p>Short, straight-haired coats and scaly, hairless tails distinguish black and brown rats. The brown rat is the larger of the two, reaching a maximum size of 68 cm. Brown rats are found in practically every inhabited region of Canada, but black rats are exclusively found along the coast of British Columbia. These are gregarious species. The black rat is an exceptional climber that lives in lofts and roofs of houses or farm buildings. Brown rats prefer to burrow.</p>
                    <p>RAT-Bourne Diseases are a group of diseases that originated in the United States. Rats are still well-known vectors of over 70 diseases, having been blamed for the Black Plague throughout the Middle Ages. Infestations of rats can be extremely dangerous to people's health. The bubonic plague and its variations are among the most severe rat-borne diseases. When infested rats or fleas attack humans, they transmit the disease. Our professional professionals can assist you in resolving any pest control issue.</p>

                    <h4>Preventing and Dealing with a Rat Infestation With Proper Control
                    </h4>

                    <p>Rats will consume nearly anything, so keep your house clean and avoid leaving food out. Check to see if your home and storage areas are clean and dry. Clean your sheds, crawlspaces, and garbage cans on a regular basis. Fill in any little gaps or cracks where they might be able to get in.</p>
